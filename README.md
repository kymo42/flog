# ⛳ FLOG - Simple Golf Rangefinder

**FLOG** is a super simple, "no-fuss" rangefinder for your **Fitbit Versa 3** or **Fitbit Sense**. 

It handles the distances so you can focus on your swing. It works on **ANY** golf course in the world because you teach it where the greens are as you play!

## 🚀 Quick Start (In 3 Simple Steps)

### 1. Start a Round
On your watch, tap **NEW COURSE**. The watch will start looking for your location (GPS).

### 2. "Mark" Your Greens
The first time you play a course, walk to the **middle of the green** on Hole 1. 
1. Tap the red **EDIT** button in the top corner (this "unlocks" the marking button).
2. Tap the yellow **MARK** button.
3. Your watch vibrates. **Done!** Now the watch knows exactly where that green is. 
4. Tap **EDIT** again to lock it (Back to "Play Mode").

### 3. Just Play
Next time you stand on the fairway, the watch will show you exactly how many **Meters** (or Yards) you are from the center of that green.

2. Tap your **Watch Icon** (top left).
3. Tap **Gallery** → **Flog** → **Settings**.
4. Type the name in the **"Course Name"** box.
5. Your watch will update instantly!

## 💡 Pro Tips for Non-Techies
*   **Wait for GPS**: When you first start, stand outside for 30 seconds. The numbers will show "---" until the watch finds the satellites.
*   **Play Mode vs Edit Mode**: Most of the time, keep it in **Play Mode** (locked). This prevents you from accidentally moving a hole marker if you bump your watch.
*   **Battery**: GPS uses a lot of battery. Make sure your watch has at least 50% charge before you start 18 holes.
*   **Saving**: You don't need to click "Save". Every time you **MARK** a hole, it is saved forever on your watch.

## 🛠 Installation for Techies
If you are installing this manually:
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run build`
3. Use the [Fitbit Developer Bridge](https://dev.fitbit.com/build/guides/command-line-interface/) to install to your watch.
