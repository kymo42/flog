# Golf Rangefinder - Quick Start Guide

## Welcome! ⛳

Your Fitbit Versa 3 is now a powerful golf rangefinder that works on ANY golf course in the world - no subscriptions, no databases, completely free!

## How It Works

The app uses your watch's built-in GPS to calculate real-time distances to golf greens. You simply mark the key positions on each hole (tee, front, middle, back of green), and the app remembers them for future rounds.

## First Time Setup

### Step 1: Allow GPS Access
When you first open the app, your watch will request GPS permissions. **Tap "Allow"** to enable location tracking.

### Step 2: Wait for GPS Lock
- Go outside with a clear view of the sky
- Wait 20-30 seconds for GPS to acquire satellites
- GPS status will show as "Good" or "Excellent" when ready
- You'll see your accuracy in meters (e.g., "±8m")

### Step 3: You're Ready!
The app is now tracking your position and ready to use.

- While walking the course before a tournament

### What to Mark

For each hole, you should mark:
1. **Tee Box** (optional, but helpful for course mapping)
2. **Front of Green** - Stand at the front edge
3. **Middle of Green** - Stand in the center  
4. **Back of Green** - Stand at the back edge
5. **Hazards** (optional) - Water, bunkers, etc.

### How to Mark Positions

1. **Navigate to the Hole**
   - Use the **◄** and **►** buttons on the main screen
   - Or tap **a hole number** if using hole selection screen

2. **Press MARK Button**
   - This opens the marking menu

3. **Walk to Position**
   - Walk to the spot you want to mark (e.g., front of green)
   - Stand still for 2-3 seconds

4. **Tap the Mark Button**
   - Tap "Mark Front", "Mark Middle", etc.
   - Your watch will vibrate to confirm
   - **Done!** That position is now saved

5. **Repeat for Each Position**
   - Mark front, middle, and back of green
   - Optionally mark tee and hazards

6. **Move to Next Hole**
   - Tap **BACK** to return to main screen
   - Tap **►** to go to next hole

### Tips for Accurate Marking

### "GPS: Searching..." for a long time

**Solutions:**

### Distances seem wrong

**Check:**
- GPS status should be "Good" or "Excellent"
- Verify you marked the correct positions  
- Poor GPS accuracy (>30m) can affect readings
- Re-mark positions if needed

### App shows "--" for all distances

**Causes:**
- No course created yet (tap MARK to create one)
- No positions marked for this hole
- GPS hasn't locked yet

**Fix:** Mark the green positions for this hole

### Watch says "No Course"

This means you haven't created a course yet.

2. App will automatically create "My Course"
